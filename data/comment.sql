I read/listened to all of them, but I didn't understand how special they were at the time, and after I listened to them I recorded over them. :'( He had a wonderful voice and he's been gone for almost 10 years now... especially now that I have a daughter of my own I'd pay a million bucks to get those recordings back. I have videos of him and such, but those tapes were such a loving gesture and they took him hours to make. I'm still hoping I'll find one of them with at least part of a recording in my parents' attic or something.");
